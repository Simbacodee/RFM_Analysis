## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

- SuperStore is a global retail company with a rapidly growing customer base. As the holiday season approaches, the Marketing team is planning to run appreciation campaigns for existing customers and identify high-potential buyers who can be nurtured into loyal customers.

- In previous years, customer segmentation was handled manually using spreadsheets due to the smaller scale of data. However, with the increasing volume of transactions and customers, manual segmentation is no longer feasible.

- To address this, the Marketing department has requested support from the Data Analytics team to automate customer segmentation. Specifically, they proposed leveraging the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to classify customers into meaningful groups for targeted marketing.

- This project aims to build a robust and scalable RFM segmentation pipeline using Python, enabling the business to better understand customer behavior and execute personalized marketing strategies efficiently.

## 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure  

### 📌 Data Source  
- Source: Provided dataset for E-commerce retail analysis
- Size: 541,910 rows × 8 columns (Sheet 1: E-commerce retail), additional segmentation details in Sheet 2
- Format: .xlsx (Excel file with two sheets)
### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

#### 1️⃣ Tables Used:  
The dataset consists of two tables (sheets):  
- Sheet 1: Ecommerce Retail – Contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store, covering all orders between December 1, 2010 and December 9, 2011. The company specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts. The majority of its customers are wholesalers, making this dataset well-suited for customer segmentation and purchasing behavior analysis.
- Sheet 2: Segmentation – Contains the RFM score combinations used to classify customers into different segments. Each record maps a specific RFM score (e.g., 555, 344, 211) to a customer label such as “Loyal Customer”, “At Risk”, or “New Customer”.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Initial Exploration
[In 1]:  

```python

# Check the general information of df
ecommerce.info()
```
[Out 1]:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd73860d-94ca-409a-a685-936dc82d176c)  

[In 2]:  

```python

# Check data summary
ecommerce.describe()
```
[Out 2]:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/213d6feb-c51c-4e71-aca3-b080cac02121)  

[In 3]:  

```python

# Print the first five rows of the dataset
ecommerce.head()
```
[Out 3]:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cafe599-3e0f-4af5-bc2e-27023c91e530)
 
To understand the data structure and assess its quality, the following initial steps were taken:

- **Dataset Overview:**
  - The dataset contains **541,909 rows** and **8 columns**.
  - Used `.info()` to check data types and null values.
  - Used `.head()` to view sample transactions.

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - `.describe()` revealed unusually large negative values in `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
  - Example: `Quantity` min = -80,995; `UnitPrice` min = -11,062 — which are not logically valid.

- **Data Type Review:**
  - No mismatched data types were detected.
  - However, some columns like `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, and `CustomerID` were later cast to `string` for better processing.

- **Missing & Duplicate Values:**
  - `CustomerID`: ~0.27% missing → Critical for segmentation.
  - `Description`: ~25% missing → Retained (not used in RFM).
  - Duplicate rows: 5,268 duplicates found.

- **Outliers Identified:**
  - `Quantity`: Values range from **-80,995** to **80,995**, with a median of just **3**. This wide spread and the presence of negative values indicate outliers, often linked to cancelled transactions.
  - `UnitPrice`: Ranges from **-11,062** to **38,970**, while 75% of prices are below **4.13**. These extremes suggest likely data entry errors or invalid records.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

The following steps were performed to clean the dataset and prepare it for segmentation:  

 [In 4]: 
```python
# Remove duplicate rows  
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail.drop_duplicates()
```
 [In 5]: 
```python
# Remove rows with missing CustomerID  
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail.dropna(subset=['CustomerID'])
```
 [In 6]:
```python
# Keep only rows where Quantity > 0  
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] > 0]
```
 [In 7]: 
```python
# Keep only rows where UnitPrice > 0  
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'] > 0]
```
 [In 8]: 
```python
# Keep only rows with valid StockCode (5-digit numbers)  
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[
    ecommerce_retail['StockCode'].astype(str).str.fullmatch(r'\d{5}')
]
```
[In 9]: 
```python
# Visualize outliers in Quantity  
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
sns.boxplot(x=ecommerce_retail['Quantity'])
plt.title('Boxplot of Quantity')
plt.show()
```
[Out 9]:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fd7f406-6c46-4d02-abcf-c7e91fa758ce)

[In 10]: 
```python
# Visualize outliers in UnitPrice  
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
sns.boxplot(x=ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'])
plt.title('Boxplot of Unit Price')
plt.show()
```
[Out 10]: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/292c3f42-47f5-41a5-8052-117567d62721)

[In 11]:

```python
# Calculate percentage of Quantity outliers using IQR  
Q1_quantity = ecommerce_retail['Quantity'].quantile(0.25)
Q3_quantity = ecommerce_retail['Quantity'].quantile(0.75)
IQR_quantity = Q3_quantity - Q1_quantity
lower_quantity = Q1_quantity - 1.5 * IQR_quantity
upper_quantity = Q3_quantity + 1.5 * IQR_quantity
outlier_quantity = ecommerce_retail[
    (ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] < lower_quantity) | 
    (ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] > upper_quantity)
]
outlier_percent_quantity = len(outlier_quantity) / len(ecommerce_retail) * 100
print(f'Outlier Quantity accounts for: {outlier_percent_quantity: .2f}%')

# Calculate percentage of UnitPrice outliers using IQR  
Q1_price = ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'].quantile(0.25)
Q3_price = ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'].quantile(0.75)
IQR_price = Q3_price - Q1_price
lower_price = Q1_price - 1.5 * IQR_price
upper_price = Q3_price + 1.5 * IQR_price
outliers_price = ecommerce_retail[
    (ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'] < lower_price) | 
    (ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'] > upper_price)
]
outlier_percent_price = len(outliers_price) / len(ecommerce_retail) * 100
print(f'Outlier UnitPrice accounts for: {outlier_percent_price: .2f}%')
```
[Out 11]:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ba9c01-c45a-4454-8a05-514b9703cbe6)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Since the percentage of outliers in `Quantity` (~6.5%) and `UnitPrice` (~8.8%) is significant,  
> instead of removing them directly, we chose to cap extreme values based on the **98th percentile of Revenue**.

[In 12]: 
```python
# Create a new column for Revenue  
ecommerce_retail['Revenue'] = ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] * ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice']
# Filter out top 5% Revenue to handle outliers  
threshold_98 = ecommerce_retail['Revenue'].quantile(0.95)
ecommerce_retail_98 = ecommerce_retail[ecommerce_retail['Revenue'] <= threshold_98]
```

## 🧮 Apply RFM Model  

[In 13]: 
```python
# Generate RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) table for customer segmentation  
snapshot_date = pd.to_datetime('2011-12-31')
ecom_filtered = ecommerce_retail_98[ecommerce_retail_98['InvoiceDate'] <= snapshot_date]
rfm = ecom_filtered.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
    'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (snapshot_date - x.max()).days,
    'InvoiceNo': 'count',
    'Revenue': 'sum'
}).reset_index()

rfm.columns = ['CustomerID','Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']
```
[In 14]: 
```python
# Score each customer based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM),
# then map combined RFM scores to predefined customer segments

rfm['R_score'] = pd.qcut(rfm['Recency'], q=5, labels=[5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
rfm['F_score'] = pd.qcut(rfm['Frequency'], q=5, labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
rfm['M_score'] = pd.qcut(rfm['Monetary'], q=5, labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

rfm['RFM_score'] = rfm['R_score'].astype(str) + rfm['F_score'].astype(str) + rfm['M_score'].astype(str)

segmentation_data = segmentation_data.rename(columns={"RFM Score": "RFM_score"})

df_segment = segmentation_data.assign(
    RFM_score=segmentation_data['RFM_score'].astype(str).str.split(', ')
).explode('RFM_score')

rfm_segmented = pd.merge(rfm, df_segment, how='left', on='RFM_score')

```
